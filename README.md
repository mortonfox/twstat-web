# twstat-web - Online Twitter stats generator

## Introduction

This is a Rails website that provides a web interface for
[twstat](https://github.com/mortonfox/twstat). twstat is a script that
generates a single web page of charts from the data in a Twitter archive.

The generated web page references the following libraries from online sources:

* jQuery (from [CDNJS](http://cdnjs.com/))
* [jQCloud](https://github.com/lucaong/jQCloud) jQuery plugin (from [CDNJS](http://cdnjs.com/))
* [Google Chart Tools](https://developers.google.com/chart/)

### Twitter archive

In December 2012, Twitter
[introduced](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html) a
feature allowing users to download an archive of their entire user timeline. By
February 2013, it was available to all users.

To request your Twitter archive:

1. Visit <https://twitter.com/settings/account>
1. Click on the "Request your archive" button. (near the bottom of the settings page)
1. Wait for an email from Twitter with a download link.

## Installation

Download the file tree and deploy it as a Rails application. This step depends
on your web hosting setup.

By default, twstat-web uses SQLite for the database backend. Edit
`config/database.yml` if you wish to use a different database server.

Sign up for a Twitter API key at <https://apps.twitter.com/> and add it to the
production section in `config/apikeys.yml`. You may also add a development API
key here if you are installing another copy for testing.

Run the following in the root of the file tree:

* `bundle install`
* `rake secret` (Use the secret key generated by this command to set the
  `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable for the user running this Rails
  application in production mode.)
* `RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate`
* `RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start`
* `bundle exec rails server -e production`

The `delayed_job` startup command should be placed in bootup actions or
equivalent at your web host.

The `rails server` startup command may also differ or be eliminated entirely
depending on your web hosting setup.

## Demo

There is a live demo at <http://qslv.com/twstat>

Note: The Tweets by Hour chart uses the UTC time zone since that's how Twitter
stores timestamps in the Twitter archive.
